Which texts are you using or analyzing? 
* A specific work of literature? 
* A corpus or corpora? 
* Newspapers? 
* Transcripts? 
* Books? 
* Audio? 
* Images?
* Video? 
* Tweets and other social network data? 

In short, consider material that isn't yours but is central to your project as source material.
